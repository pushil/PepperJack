  A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandwich" target="_blank" title="wiki">sandwich</a> is a food typically consisting of vegetables, sliced cheese or meat, placed on or between slices of bread, or more generally any dish wherein bread serves as a container or wrapper for another food type.<br>
  The sandwich began as a portable finger food in the Western world, though over time it has become prevalent worldwide. The 3rd of November marks the National Sandwich Day.<br>
  Sandwiches are a popular type of lunch food, taken to work, school, or picnics to be eaten as part of a packed lunch. The bread may be plain or be coated with condiments, such as mayonnaise or mustard, to enhance its flavour and texture.<br>
  As well as being homemade, sandwiches are also widely sold in restaurants and can be served hot or cold.<br>
  There are both savoury sandwiches, such as deli meat sandwiches, and sweet sandwiches, such as a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.<br>
  The sandwich is named after its supposed inventor, John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich.<br>
  The Wall Street Journal has described it as Britain's "biggest contribution to gastronomy"
